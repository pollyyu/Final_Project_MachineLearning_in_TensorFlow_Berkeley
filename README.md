# Final_Project_MachineLearning_in_TensorFlow_Berkeley
This is the final project of Berkeley extension's Machine Learning Course in TensorFlow.

Project Proposal: 
The dataset, obtained from Kaggle is a list of ~20,000 recipes listed by rating, nutritional information and assigned category that is already parsed. The feature size is large (678 count) but extremely sparse. Hence, I thought that the dataset would make a great candidate to build a model combining linear model and a deep feed-forward neural network (using DNNLinearCombinedClassifier). I plan to predict the public rating of recipes based on continuous and categorical features given in the dataset.
